; The file locations for personal changes are (~ stands for the users home directory)

;  ~/.pyHegel
;   or if you follow the default XDG standard (in linux): ~/.config/pyHegel
;   under windows it could also be in ~/AppData/Roaming/UdeS_Reulet/pyHegel
; For global changes (all users)
;   if you follow the default XDG standard (in linux):
;      /etc/xdg/pyHegel
;      otherwise in /etc/pyHegel
;   under windows it could be in /ProgramData/UdeS_Reulet/pyHegel
;   Finally you can place the file within the pyHegel python package
