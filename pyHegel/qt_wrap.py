"""
Wrapper to handle various combinations of PyQt4(api1 and 2), PyQt5 and PySide
You should import this after the Qt library has been loaded (by ipython
and/or matplotlib). Then it will use the previously loaded one.
Only one of the possible Qt librairies should be loaded.
If none are loaded, a default set is tried in order.
"""

# PySide is very similar to PyQt4 api2
# inspired by ipython IPython/external/qt_loaders.py (ipython 2.4.1)

# The difference between api1 and 2 is that for 2, QVariants and QStrings
# are automatically transformed and are not used in python.
# So for code to be portable, do not use QStrings or QVariants.

# for compatibility, use QtCore.Signal, QtCore.Slot instead of
#  QtCore.pyqtSignal, QtCore.pyqtSlot

# Only use new style slot/signal
# so no SIGNAL or SLOT functions
# this requiers PyQt4 >v4.5
# If no selection is done for a signal (emit, connect) then the default one is used
# (the one listed in the documentation). Otherwise, select them in the following way:
#  obj.signal1[int]  # for signal1(int)
#  obj.signal2[str, int] # for signal2(QString, int)
#  obj.signal3[()] # for signal3()
# Note that all the overload signals act separatelly. emitting one does nothing
# for the others. So code should emit all the overloaded signals together.

# Note that Qt (C++) allows a signal to connect to a slot with any number of parameters
# less than or equal than the signal (they don't have to be parameters with default
# values). Signal with parameter that have default values will have multiple signatures.
# For example sig(int x=1), will have signatures sig(int) and sig().
# A connection can be made to an invalid slot (wrong parameter signature), in which case the code
# shows an error on the console during run time at connect time (but code still runs)
#
# Under PyQt4 or PySide conecting a builtin slot with the wrong parameters
# produces a caught exception at call time.
# During emit, PyQt4,5 produces an exception for wrong parameters
# while PySide will silently converts them (I have seen str converted to float(0.))
# at least for PyQt4-4.11.3-1.fc21.x86_64
#              python-qt5-5.4.1-1.fc21.x86_64
#              python-pyside-1.2.2-2.fc21.x86_64
#              qt-4.8.6-28.fc21.x86_64
# test like this:
# # one of the following 3 lines
# from PyQt4 import QtGui, QtCore; Signal = QtCore.pyqtSignal
# from PySide import QtGui, QtCore; Signal = QtCore.Signal
# from PyQt5 import QtCore, QtWidgets as QtGui; Signal = QtCore.pyqtSignal
#
# qapp = QtGui.QApplication([])
# class C(QtGui.QDoubleSpinBox):
#     tests = Signal([int], [float], [str], [QtCore.QObject], [])
# c=C()
# # These always work
# c.tests.emit(1)
# c.tests.emit(1.) # emits an integer
# c.tests[int].emit(1)
# c.tests[float].emit(5.5)
# c.tests[str].emit('hello')
# c.tests[()].emit()
# c.tests[QtCore.QObject].emit(c)
# # These should probably fail but do not
# c.tests[int].emit('hello')
# c.tests[int].emit(None)
# c.tests[int].emit([])
# c.tests[int].emit({})
# c.tests[int].emit(object())
# c.tests[str].emit(None) # This fails but only on PyQt4
# # These fail on PyQt4 and PyQt5 but not PySide
# c.tests[str].emit(5)
# c.tests[float].emit('hello')
# # These fail on all (wrong number of arguments)
# c.tests[int].emit(1,2)
# c.tests[int].emit()
# c.tests[()].emit(1)
