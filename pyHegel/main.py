# Main program to start pyHegel
#  It replaces the older C version of Hegel

# The routine below helps to start pyHegel in a proper ipython environment
# and then reload it when necessary.

# To properly fix the scipy CTRL-C problem (that CTRL-C ends the program)
# requires to first execute fix_scipy, then import IPython and scipy (any order).
# If IPython is loaded before fix_scipy, then CTRL-C ending programs is fixed
# however, it is no longer possible to stop time.sleep (becomes unbreakable)
# because IPython imports time (and normally installs a handler but fix_scipy
# later installs another handler that does not call any previously installed ones)
# The is a similar problem with starting within a pure python prompt since it also
# imports the time module.

# if you need to access the commands in a script/import import pyHegel.commands

Informations
we could use --pylab instead of --matplotlib, but I choose --matplotlib for better control
see the help of %pylab to see what it does. The code is in IPython.core.pylabtools.import_pylab
and it protects the result of %who from being contamianted by all those imports
The code is called from core.interactiveshell.enable_pylab()
which is called from core.magics.pylab pylab
and core.shellapp.InteractiveShellApp.init_gui_pylab

"from pylab import *" and "from matplotlib.pylab import *" are the same.
They "import numpy as np" and also "from numpy import *" and then
"from matplotlib.pyplot import *" and "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt" as well as
many other numpy and matplotlib sections.

We used the xy profile which executed (after starting pylab)
    import numpy
    import scipy
    from numpy import *
Then it started dated logger in .xy directory, but multiple terminal would merge into
the same file.
So the import_pylab ends up also loading numpy and  doing "from numpy import *"
after importing pylab. So it is the same as before except for scipy and logging.

Changes from IPython 2.1 vs 0.10
*   -pylab used to only "from matplotlib.pylab import *" not numpy but pylab did import numpy internally and still does
    It did not have %pylab or %matplotlib macros
    Now -pylab is deprecated. Use --pylab instead or %pylab interactivelly (well ipython
    recommends to use matplotlib and only import what is required)
    --pylab now also adds figsize, display and getfigs to the environment
*   autocall is now disabled by default (it used to be enabled.)
*   omit__names went from 0 (none) to 2 (omit names staring with _ whe using tab)
*   CTRL-L went from doing possible-completions to clear-screen
*   there is no longer a message cmdline option, nor a log option
*   the pylab imports do about the same things.
*   The configuration used to be loaded this way:
     The defaults are initialized in IPython/ipmaker.py
     rc files are loaded before executing the ipy_someprofile_conf.py
     ipythonrc-PROF or simply ipythonrc if not present or not using a profile
     ipy_system_conf
     ipy_profile_PROF (if rc file was not loaded only else ipy_profile_none)
     ipy_user_conf
    In our case the config loaded was $USER/_ipython/ipythonrc.ini (which is the same as the default IPython/UserConfig/ipythonrc) then
    IPython/Extensions/ipy_profile_xy.py (which executed xy.startup.run()) then
    $USER/_ipython/ipy_user_conf.py (which was the same as the default IPython/UserConfig/ipy_user_conf.py)
    Above, when I compare default settings, it is with respect to the result of those files.
*   CTRL-C behavior has changed
     pressing it does not save the current line (it was a bug when ipython was running the Qt handler)
     when Qt is running, it requires pressing it twice, otherwise you return to editing the line.
*   The history is saved in a database file, connected to the sessions and after each commands
    so badly ending a session (closing the window) will no longer loose the history.
    To read old history, use
       %history -l 100
       #read last session
       %history ~1/0-~/0
       %history ~10/1-~0/1000
    Therefore logging is no longer necessary. But can use %history -f some file
    or %logstart ...
*   The -i option to ipython did not change anything. It would always go into interactive mode.
*   the banner was shown after the external script was loaded
