def start_pyHegel():
    """ This is the recommanded way to start pyHegel.
        It starts ipython in a standard way (pylab, autocall enabled,...)
        and then loads and initializes the pyHegel commands.

        If the python session was started with command line arguments
        --console, it will try to start pyHegel in the Console program
        that comes with pythonxy. This is windows only.

        If you later need access to the commands in a module:
            import pyHegel.commands as cmds
            cmds.get(somedevice)
        or
            from pyHegel.commands import *
            get(somedevice)
        or any other variants you want.
