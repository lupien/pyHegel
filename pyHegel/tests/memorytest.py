       This will create a plot or a traces.Trace (if trace=True) with m data points.
       multiple times (n times).
       Using the defaults should not cause a memory leak. If it does we have a
       problem (again).
       Running with trace=True, should cause a problem (which is fixed with trace='new')
       n:     number of repeats
       m:     number of data points per graph
       trace: if True (default) uses traces.Trace,
              when False uses figure, clf and plot
       newfig: wether to use a new figure for each iteration or
               to reuse the same one (when False)
       drawit: When True, forces a call to draw to update the plot.
               Only usefull for plot, since traces always does that
               call internally.
               Now that draw produces the data then calls the widget update which
               queues a paintEvent.
       closeit: When True, 'old' or 'new', the figure/trace gets closed (like pressing
                the close button on the window). In theory this should clear the memory.
                Obviously, turning this off will not release any memory so
                it can quickly produces a memory error (with default n,m)
                when using a 32 bit python.
                'new' or True selects the new way of closing the traces.Trace window.
                'old' is the old one which was causing a memory leak.
       close_before: When True, the close is done before running processEvents
                     When False, it is after.
                     When closeit is False, this has no effect.
       collect:  When True, calls the python garbage collector before the start
                 of the next iteration
       sendpost: When True, will call sendpost with DeferredDelete just after
                 processEvents is called (and only if that is enabled) to
                 handle the deleteLater events caused by closing a window
                 (as long as the windows has the Qt::WA_DeleteOnClose flag).
                 When disabled the DeferredDelete are not handled by
                 processEvents, so the Widget is only deleted if python deletes
                 it or when we return to the main event loop (when the function
                 terminates if called from the console.)
       proc_time_ms: the number of milliseconds to use for
                     processEvents. This empties the event queue and is called
                     as long as new event show up and the duration is less
                     than proc_time_ms.
                     Therefore the actual time can be shorter (event 0) if
                     no events are pending. And longer if emptying the queue
                     takes a long time (try:
                         foo=plot(randn(1000000)); to=time.time(); QtGui.QApplication.processEvents(QtCore.QEventLoop.AllEvents, 20); print(time.time()-to))
                     Use a negative value (like -1) to disable this call.
                     Without this call, no widget update will happen (no paint
                     no response to mouse, ...)
