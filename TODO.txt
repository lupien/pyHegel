Related to update to newer ipython
-maybe get the default timezone for matplotlib using
  https://github.com/regebro/tzlocal
-Handle optional command line argument (like a file to execute) in pyHegel.py
-Report fixes to matplotlib website
  qt4 backend has added most keys (except backspace. But it is still behind gtk)
  key_press_handler has not changed (still does not reorder overlayed axes so you can't
  see the x,y values except for the last axes.)
-create icons for pyHegel
